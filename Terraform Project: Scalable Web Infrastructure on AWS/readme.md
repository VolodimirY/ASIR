# üöÄ Terraform Project: Scalable Web Infrastructure on AWS

This project provisions a scalable, load-balanced web infrastructure on **Amazon Web Services** using **Terraform**, an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. The configuration automates the creation of a VPC with public subnets, an Application Load Balancer, EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), and dynamic scaling policies based on traffic and CPU utilization.

## üìå Key Features

- **Custom VPC** with two public subnets across different Availability Zones.
- **Internet Gateway** and **public route table** for external access.
- **Security Group** allowing inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.
- **Application Load Balancer** to distribute traffic between instances.
- **Launch Template** for EC2 configuration.
- **Auto Scaling Group** with scaling policies triggered by:
  - **CPU utilization** 
  - **Request count per target** 
- **Health checks** configured on the ALB Target Group.
